## Data Clean Up 
The follow is a significant portion of the code used to clean and filter the data for industry level analysis
#Find total employees laid off in Top 5 companies and then all others and display results
industry_totals = grouped_df_a['Laid_Off'].sum()
top_5 = industry_totals.sort_values(ascending=False).head(5)
other = industry_totals.sort_values(ascending=False).reset_index().iloc[5:]
top_5_df = pd.DataFrame(top_5)
display(other)
display(top_5_df)

# Plot a pie chart for percentage comparison
# Define colors for the slices
colors = ['dodgerblue', 'deepskyblue', 'orange', 'seagreen', 'darkslategrey', 'red']

# Plot the pie chart

pie = industry_df.plot.pie(y='Laid_Off',
                           autopct='%1.1f%%',  # Display percentages
                           startangle=140,
                           shadow=True,
                           colors=colors,
                           pctdistance=0.85,
                           wedgeprops={'edgecolor': 'black', 'linewidth': 1, 'antialiased': True},
                           textprops={'rotation': 0, 'fontname': 'Arial', 'color': 'White'}
                          )
#Refine the pie chart for readability and understanding
plt.title('Top 5 Industries Impacted vs All Other Industries (by total employees laid off)', fontsize=14)
plt.axis('equal')
plt.ylabel('')

plt.show()
